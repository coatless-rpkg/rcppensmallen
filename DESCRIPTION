Description: 'Ensmallen' is a templated C++ mathematical optimization library 
 (by the 'MLPACK' team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an
 objective function to optimize. Provided within are various standard and
 cutting-edge optimizers that include full-batch gradient descent techniques, 
 small-batch techniques, gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.
 The 'RcppEnsmallen' package includes the header files from the 'Ensmallen' library
 and pairs the appropriate header files from 'armadillo' through the 
 'RcppArmadillo' package. Therefore, users do not need to install 'Ensmallen' nor
 'Armadillo' to use 'RcppEnsmallen'. Note that 'Ensmallen' is licensed under 
 3-Clause BSD, 'Armadillo' starting from 7.800.0 is licensed under Apache License 2,
 'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Armadillo') is licensed under 
 the GNU GPL version 2 or later. Thus, 'RcppEnsmallen' is also licensed under
 similar terms. Note that 'Ensmallen' requires a compiler that supports 
 'C++11' and 'Armadillo' 9.800 or later.
